# For some reason several of the lines include html <span> tags in addition to <p> tags.

# <p>Orange (25 100 100)</p>
# <p>YellowÂ <span>(58 100 100)</span></p>

# Followed by one monstrously long string of sed commands
# Penultimate command removes any meta-characters (any groups of consecutive non-alphanumerica chars replaced with one comma.

# Now re-read the newly written files and concatenate their modified contents into one big file
# Yes, kludgy that I didn't make this part of the first loop above


# To check whether all files have same number of lines first:
# for f in $(ls ./submissions/*.txt); do wc -l $f; done
#
# To see id # as well:
# counter=1; for f in $(ls ./submissions/*.txt); do echo "   $counter"; wc -l $f; let "counter=counter+1"; done
#
# This is worth doing because some extra lines will get printed for some students, e.g. if they pasted the line of dashes into their answers.  Also good for finding answers with no text in them. 
# These kinds of problems should be fixed by hand, by editing the BIG_FILE.

# delete any existing version of the file
rm $BIG_FILE

# Print a header row for R:
echo "id,colorName,HUE,SAT,VAL" >> $BIG_FILE
