**In-class Assignment #2\\
Color Choices**

Each person's concept of the color that corresponds to a particular word is different, even though when we speak these words we assume that everyone understands what color we ourselves are imagining.  This assignment asks you to identify //your// personal interpretation of common color words, which the instructor will then compare with your fellow students choices.  

Your identity will never appear in any of the graphs and pictures that the instructor will prepare.  

 

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Use the following online color picker to show which color best matches each of the most common color words from the English language.  Please continue reading these instructions to get to the list of color words.

Here's what the worksheet will look like after you start filling it in:

 

 

Begin by showing us what //you// think each color looks like.  Use this online color picker to click around until the color displayed matches your concept of, for example, "red."\\

To communicate your personal color choices, you will type in **HSB coordinates** (3 numbers) for each word.

**HSB coordinates:** using an online color picker, adjust the appearance of the color to match each word you wrote. Please pick the color that best matches your personal impression of what is most typical for each color word.  Record **just the top 3** **numbers** for the color in **HSB** coordinates.  **HSB **stands for **H**ue, **S**aturation, and **B**rightness.  

If you are typing the numbers instead of copy-and-pasting, you can just round to the nearest integer value. 

 Here's a high-tech screenshot showing which numbers to use after you've clicked on your color choice:

**To submit your choices:**

**1) Fill in your choices for the first 9 colors on the worksheet**

After filling in the HSB numbers, please answer the following as well:

  * **Like** - How much do you like this color?
  * **Wear** - How much do you like to //wear// this color?
  * **Misery-pleasure** - Where does your attitude towards this color fall on this scale that accounts for one major dimension of emotion?
  * **Sleepiness-arousal** - This is a second dimension of emotion.  "Arousal" is a general term, related to "energetic" and "active."
  * **Adjective** - Which adjective captures your thoughts or feelings about this color best?
  * **Example object** - What is the most typical object that has this color?  (Use underscores instead of spaces for multi-word names, e.g. "fire_engine" instead of "fire engine").
  * **Letter** and **Numeral** - Occasionally people have strong associations between these things and specific colors.  If you don't have any, just select "NA"
  * **Are you a synesthete?** Color-grapheme synesthetes are people who reliably experience the same color every time they see a particular letter, number, symbol or word.  This is relatively rare, but some studies propose that about 3% of the population might experience this. 
  * **Gender** - If you would like to put female, male, or prefer not to answer, please use the drop-down selections.  You can always type a different response than those  -- please ignore any annoying warning messages you might see if you do this.  

 

**2) Add a few additional color words of your choice to the first column, and fill those rows in too.**

Please type over the text that is already in those cells.  

 

**3) //Download the completed worksheet as a .csv file, and upload that to this Canvas page.//**

Here's a screenshot showing how to do this from the worksheet.

The downloaded file usually ends up in a folder named "Downloads" on your computer.
